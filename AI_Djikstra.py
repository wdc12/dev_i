''' Dijkstra algorithm is a single-source shortest path algorithm. Here, single-source means that only one source is given, and we have to find the shortest path from the source to all the nodes.
Dijkstra's Algorithm Complexity
Time Complexity: O(E Log V)

where, E is the number of edges and V is the number of vertices.

Space Complexity: O(V)

Dijkstra's Algorithm Applications
To find the shortest path
In social networking applications
In a telephone network
To find the locations in the map '''
