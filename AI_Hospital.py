'''
A system that uses human expertise to make complicated decisions.Simulates reasoning by
applying knowledge and interfaces.Uses expertâ€™s knowledge as rules and data within the
system.Models the problem solving ability of a human expert.
Components of an ES:
1. Knowledge Base
i. Represents all the data and information inputed by experts in the field.
ii. Stores the data as a set of rules that the system must follow to make decisions.
2. Reasoning or Inference Engine
i. Asks the user questions about what they are looking for.
ii. Applies the knowledge and the rules held in the knowledge base.
iii. Appropriately uses this information to arrive at a decision.
3. User Interface
i. Allows the expert system and the user to communicate.
ii. Finds out what it is that the system needs to answer.
iii. Sends the user questions or answers and receives their response.
4. Explanation Facility
i. Explains the systems reasoning and justifies its conclusions.
