now type all these commands in cloud shell:

? mkdir quickstart
? cd quickstart
? git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/html-docs-hello-world.git
? cd html-docs-hello-world
? az webapp up --location westeurope --name <app_name> --html
delete the group to end:

Theory:
What is Azure?
Azure is a complete cloud platform that can host your existing applications and streamline new
application development. Azure can even enhance on-premises applications. Azure integrates the
cloud services that you need to develop, test, deploy, and manage your applications, all while
taking advantage of the efficiencies of cloud computing.
This guide is an introduction to the Azure platform for application developers. It provides
guidance and direction that you need to start building new applications in Azure or migrating
existing applications to Azure.

Where do I start?
With all the services that Azure offers, it can be an intimidating task to figure out which services
you need to support your solution architecture. This section highlights the Azure services that
developers commonly use.
Now, let's look at some of the specific services that we recommend investigating for your
applications.

Hosted storage and data access:
Most applications must store data, so however you decide to host your application in Azure,
consider one or more of the following storage and data services.
Azure Cosmos DB: A globally distributed, multi-model database service. This database
enables you to elastically scale throughput and storage across any number of geographical
regions with a comprehensive SLA.
Azure Storage: Offers durable, highly available storage for blobs, queues, files, and other
kinds of nonrelational data. Storage provides the storage foundation for VMs.
Azure SQL Database: An Azure-based version of the Microsoft SQL Server engine for
storing relational tabular data in the cloud. SQL Database provides predictable
performance, scalability with no downtime, business continuity, and data protection.

Experiment No. 10
Installation and Configuration of virtualization using KVM

https://www.linuxfordevices.com/tutorials/ubuntu/fix-unable-to-acquire-the-dpkg-frontend-lock

Open terminal
sudo apt install virt-manager
sudo apt install cpu-checker
sudo virt-manager

VM opens -> select kvm -> New Virtual machine -> upload iso and configure -> hilao

ISO Win7 : https://tech-latest.com/download-windows-7-iso/

Optional codes:

sudo virt-manager // is a desktop user interface for managing virtual machines through libvirt
sudo apt install cpu-checker // ibvirt is an open-source API, daemon and management tool for
managing platform virtualization. It can be used to manage KVM,
sudo kvm-ok
sudo apt update
sudo apt install qemu qemu-kvm libvirt-bin bridge-utils virt-manager
sudo service libvirtd start
sudo update-rc.d libvirtd enable
service libvirtd status
sudo vi /etc/netplan/50-cloud-init.yaml
sudo netplan apply //a utility for easily configuring networking on a linux system.
sudo netplan --debug apply
sudo networkctl status -a // Creating a bridge for virtual machine reCreating a bridge
for virtual machinidge for virtual machines
Ifconfig ///displays the current configuration for a network interface when no optional
parameters are supplied
sudo virt-manager

Theory:
 Virtualization is software that separates physical infrastructures to create various 
dedicated resources. It is the fundamental technology that powerscloud computing.
 The technology behind virtualization is known as a virtual machine monitor (VMM) or
virtual manager, which separates compute environments from the actual physical
infrastructure.
 Virtualization makes servers, workstations, storage and other systems independent of the 
physical hardware layer. This is done by installing a Hypervisor on top of the hardware
layer, where the systems are then installed.There are three areas of IT where virtualization 
is making headroads, network virtualization, storage virtualization and server 
virtualization:
 Network virtualization is a method of combining the available resources in a network by 
splitting up the available bandwidth into channels,each of which is independent from the 
others, and each of which can be assigned (or reassigned) to a particular server or device
in real time. The ideais that virtualization disguises the true complexity of the network by
separating it into manageable parts, much like your partitioned hard drive makes it easier 
to manage your files.
 Storage virtualization is the pooling of physical storage from multiple network storage
devices into what appears to be a single storage device that is managed from a central 
console. Storage virtualization is commonly used in storage area networks (SANs).
 Server virtualization is the masking of server resources (including the number and 
identity of individual physical servers, processors, and operating systems) from server 
users. The intention is to spare the user from having to understand and manage 
complicated details of server resources while increasing resource sharing and utilization 
and maintaining the capacity to expand later.
 Virtualization can be viewed as part of an overall trend in enterprise IT that includes
autonomic computing, a scenario in which the IT environment will beable to manage itself 
based on perceived activity, and utility computing, in which computer processing power is 
seen as a utility that clients can pay for only as needed. The usual goal of virtualization is to 
centralize administrative tasks while improving scalability and work loads.

Experiment No. 11
Creating an Application in SalesForce.com using Apex programming Language.

Go to Settings Gear icon -> Developer Console -> File -> New -> ApexClass -> Write code:

Code:
public class Search {
    public static void main(){
        system.debug('Hello world!!');
    }
}

public class LinearSearch {
    public static void main(Integer key) {
        System.debug('Linear Search');
        
        integer s = -1;
        
        List<integer> lon = new List<integer> ();
        
        lon.add(3);
        lon.add(4);
        lon.add(5);
        lon.add(6);
        
        System.debug('List: ' + lon);
        
        for(integer i = 0; i < lon.size(); i++) {
            if(key == lon[i]) {
                s = 1;
            }
        }
        if(s == 1) {
            System.debug('Element found');
        }
        else {
            System.debug('Element not found');
        }
    }
}

Go to Debug -> Open execute anonymous window -> write Search.main(); -> OpenLog tick -> Execute -> Debug Only.

Theory:
1. Salesforce:
Salesforce is a cloud computing service as a software (SaaS) company that specializes in
customer relationship management (CRM). Salesforce's services allow businesses to use
cloud technology to better connect with customers, partners and potential customers. The
software has become the number one for customer success and helps businesses
track customer activity, market to customers and many more services. Salesforce is a
customer relationship management solution that brings companies and customers together. It
is one integrated CRM platform that gives all your departments — including marketing,
sales, commerce, and service — a single, shared view of every customer.

2. Salesforce Lightning Experience:
Salesforce Lightning Experience is simply referred to as “Lightning”. When working with
lightning Salesforce we will learn about different Salesforce lightning topics like Lightning
Login, Lightning App Builder, Lightning for Outlook, Salesforce Lightning Components,
Lightning Sync and many more. Some of them are applicable in Lightning Experience only,
but some others will work in both Lightning Experience and older Classic user interfaces.
Lightning Sync is used to sync your user contacts and events between your email server with
Salesforce.
